> **A complete case study report reimagining enterprise SaaS discovery and access.**  
> By **Gopal Rawat**

## 📖 Project Overview
This repository contains my **full case study report** for the Zluri Product Management Internship assignment.  

The challenge:  
Enterprises face constant friction when employees try to discover and access software.  
- Shadow IT emerges when employees can’t find approved tools.  
- IT teams waste countless hours answering repetitive access questions.  
- Productivity suffers when people rely on suboptimal, hidden, or duplicate apps.  

👉 My solution: an **Employee App Catalog** — an *internal app store* designed to let employees **search, explore, and request access** to approved apps in a consumer-grade, self-service experience.
